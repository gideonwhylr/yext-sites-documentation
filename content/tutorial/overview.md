Yext Sites makes it easy to create high-performance websites based on a Knowledge Graph.
To do so, you will use 3 parts of the Yext Platform 


![diagram](/images/diagram1.png)

1. **The Knowledge Graph** - A powerful and easy-to-use database to store and edit your data 
2. **Yext Streams** - A pipeline that sends data to you Site. In this tutorial we will start small, but Streams are designed to handle high volume of data updates. Yext can process thousands of data updates a second.   
3. **Yext Sites** -  The frontend that your customers see  

These components of the Yext Platform are designed to work together to give you a powerful and flexible toolkit. 

##### How it all fits together

At a high level, Streams allow you to create web pages programmatically based on data in the Knowledge Graph. 

Typically, you will have a separate stream for each entity type in the Graph.

For example, if you want to create pages for each store in your Graph, you will create a dedicated stream in the `/yext-streams` directory of your project.  

The stream configuration file will look something like this:  

{{< code lang="json" >}} {
    "streamData" : {
        "label" : "storepages"
      }, 
    "template": "store_pages.tmpl",
    "url" : "{ {{.name}}-{{.entityId}}.html }"
}{{</ code >}} 

In this file you define 
- The stream you're going to use, by picking a label  
- The template you will use for the pages generated by the stream 
- The URL structure of the stream-generated pages

Let's dive in to see how this all fits together. We reccomend you go through the tutorial steps in order, in order to build up the basic concepts step by step.
